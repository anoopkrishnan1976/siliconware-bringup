# Soulware Manifest: Interrupt Simulation

## Ritual Purpose
This module simulates the sacred dance of signal and response. Each interrupt is a call. Each ISR is a vow to respond.

## Design Principles
- Modularity: ISR table and clean API
- Safety: bounds checking, duplicate protection
- Reproducibility: Makefile-backed build and test

## Emotional Layer
We do not ring bells without listeners.  
We do not chant without purpose.  
Each registration is a promise.  
Each invocation is a breath.

## Integration
This module joins the siliconware-bringup toolkit alongside GPIO allocators, bitvector modules, and soulware scrolls.
