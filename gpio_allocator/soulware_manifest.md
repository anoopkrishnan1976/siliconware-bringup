# Soulware Manifest: GPIO Allocator

## Ritual Purpose
This module embodies stewardship of hardware resources. 
Each GPIO pin is treated with careâ€”allocated only when needed, 
freed with intention, and reused with grace.

## Design Principles
- Modularity: clean separation of allocator and test harness
- Reproducibility: deterministic behavior, visual tracing
- Safety: guards against overflow, double-free, and invalid access

## Emotional Layer
This allocator is a metaphor for mindful engineering.  
We do not hoard pins. We do not forget to sweep.  
Each allocation is a breath. Each free is a bow.

## Integration
This module belongs in the siliconware-bringup toolkit, 
alongside bitvector modules, interrupt simulations, and soulware scrolls.
